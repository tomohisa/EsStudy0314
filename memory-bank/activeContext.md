# Active Context: EsCQRSQuestions

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the initial implementation of the EsCQRSQuestions project and fixed several issues including build errors, SignalR connectivity issues, and UI update problems. Our current focus is on:

1. **Testing and Refinement**: Testing the application and refining the implementation
2. **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks
3. **User Experience Improvements**: Enhancing the user interface and experience
4. **Documentation**: Documenting the application architecture and usage

The immediate priority is to refine the existing implementation and address any issues that arise during testing:

- Improving error handling and resilience
- Optimizing performance for large numbers of responses
- Enhancing the user interface and experience
- Adding authentication for the admin page

## Recent Changes

We have made significant progress on the EsCQRSQuestions project:

- Implemented the Question aggregate, events, commands, and queries
- Set up the API endpoints for question management and responses
- Implemented real-time communication using SignalR
- Created the admin page (/planning) and participant page (/questionair)
- Integrated the frontend with the backend using SignalR for real-time updates
- Fixed build errors related to accessing aggregate payloads in query handlers
- Resolved ambiguous reference issues with IHttpMessageHandlerFactory by creating a custom interface
- Added reference to the AdminWeb project in the AppHost project
- Removed references to admin planning features from the user web interface

Recent UI improvements and bug fixes:

- Fixed issue in Questionair.razor where comment section would show regardless of whether a question option was selected
- Added "Waiting to show question" message when no option is selected
- Fixed issue where Planning.razor would not redraw when a question was added
- Enhanced SignalR event handling to ensure UI updates properly when other users answer questions
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the application
- Added explicit UI refresh calls to ensure consistent state updates

Latest improvements:

- Fixed Active Users counter issues:
  - Improved SignalR connection stability with more aggressive reconnection settings
  - Added detailed connection state logging for better debugging
  - Modified user tracking to only count survey participants (not admin users)
  - Updated QuestionHub.cs to separate admin and participant roles
  - Added explicit role-based connection handling (JoinAdminGroup and JoinAsSurveyParticipant)

## Next Steps

1. **Add Authentication**:
   - Implement authentication for the admin page
   - Restrict access to the admin page to authorized users only
   - Add login and logout functionality

2. **Further Improve Error Handling**:
   - Enhance error handling for network-related issues
   - Implement reconnection logic for SignalR
   - Add more informative error messages

3. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize the Question aggregate for large numbers of responses
   - Implement caching where appropriate

4. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - Add more detailed statistics and visualizations
   - Implement export functionality for survey results
   - Add support for multiple active questions
   - Add question categories or tags

5. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Conduct end-to-end testing
   - Perform performance testing
   - Test across different browsers and devices

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Aggregate Design**:
   - Each question will be a separate aggregate
   - Responses will be part of the question aggregate
   - This design simplifies the domain model but may require optimization for questions with many responses

2. **SignalR Integration**:
   - SignalR will be used for all real-time updates
   - Events from the domain will trigger SignalR notifications
   - Clients will subscribe to specific channels based on their role (admin or participant)

3. **Storage Strategy**:
   - Development will use in-memory storage for simplicity
   - Production will target Azure Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL
   - The choice between Cosmos DB and PostgreSQL will depend on scaling requirements

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**:
   - Event sourcing can lead to performance issues with large event streams
   - We may need to implement snapshots for frequently accessed aggregates
   - SignalR connections need to be managed efficiently for many concurrent users

2. **Security**:
   - The admin page (/planning) needs to be secured
   - For simplicity, we'll start with a basic authentication mechanism
   - In a production environment, proper authentication and authorization would be required

3. **User Experience**:
   - The UI needs to be responsive and intuitive
   - Real-time updates should be seamless and not disrupt the user experience
   - Error handling should be graceful and informative

### Current Challenges

1. **Authentication**:
   - Implementing authentication for the admin page
   - Balancing security with ease of use
   - Integrating authentication with the existing application

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Handling large numbers of responses efficiently
   - Optimizing SignalR connections for many concurrent users
   - Ensuring the UI remains responsive during high-frequency updates

3. **User Experience Refinement**:
   - Enhancing the statistics and visualization capabilities
   - Improving the participant experience
   - Making the admin interface more intuitive and powerful

4. **Real-time Synchronization**:
   - Ensuring consistent real-time updates across all clients
   - Handling edge cases like network disconnections
   - Optimizing SignalR event handling for better performance
   - Maintaining accurate active user counts across multiple clients

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented the core functionality of the EsCQRSQuestions application:

1. **Admin Functionality**:
   - Creating and editing questions with multiple-choice options
   - Starting and stopping the display of questions to participants
   - Viewing real-time statistics and individual responses
   - Real-time UI updates when questions are added, modified, or deleted

2. **Participant Functionality**:
   - Viewing active questions
   - Submitting responses with optional comments
   - Seeing real-time updates of other participants' responses
   - Improved UI with conditional display of comment section
   - Real-time statistics visible to all participants

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Event sourcing using the Sekiban framework
   - Real-time communication using SignalR
   - API endpoints for commands and queries
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

The application is now functional and ready for testing and refinement.
