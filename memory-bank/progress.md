# Progress: EsCQRSQuestions

## What Works

We have made significant progress on the EsCQRSQuestions project. Currently, the following components are in place:

- **Project Planning**: The project plan has been documented, outlining the requirements and architecture
- **Memory Bank**: Documentation has been set up to track project context and progress
- **Domain Model**: The Question aggregate, events, commands, and queries have been implemented
- **API Endpoints**: API endpoints for question management and responses have been set up
- **SignalR Integration**: Real-time communication has been implemented using SignalR
- **Frontend Pages**: The admin page (/planning) and participant page (/questionair) have been created

## What's Left to Build

While we have implemented the core functionality, there are still some areas that could be improved:

### Backend Components
- [x] Solution structure and project setup
- [x] Domain model (Question aggregate, events, commands)
- [x] Command handlers for question management
- [x] Query handlers for retrieving questions and responses
- [x] Projections for read models
- [x] SignalR hub for real-time communication
- [x] API endpoints for commands and queries
- [x] Event store configuration (in-memory for development)

### Frontend Components
- [x] Blazor application structure
- [x] Layout and navigation
- [x] Admin page (/planning)
  - [x] Question creation form
  - [x] Question management UI
  - [x] Response statistics display
- [x] Participant page (/questionair)
  - [x] Welcome screen
  - [x] Question display
  - [x] Response submission form
- [x] SignalR client integration
- [x] Real-time updates

### Enhancements
- [ ] Authentication for the admin page
- [ ] More detailed statistics and visualizations
- [ ] Export functionality for survey results
- [ ] Multiple active questions support
- [ ] Question categories or tags

### Integration and Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Documentation

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Implementation Complete

We have successfully implemented the core functionality of the EsCQRSQuestions application. The application now allows:

1. Administrators to create, edit, and manage questions
2. Administrators to control when questions are displayed to participants
3. Participants to view active questions and submit responses
4. Real-time updates when new responses are submitted
5. Statistics and visualization of response data

The application is built using event sourcing principles with the Sekiban framework, and uses SignalR for real-time communication between the server and clients.

## Known Issues

While the core functionality is working, there are some known issues and limitations:

1. **Security**: The admin page (/planning) is not secured with authentication. Anyone who knows the URL can access it.

2. **Performance**: The current implementation includes responses within the question aggregate, which may lead to performance issues if a question receives a large number of responses.

3. **Error Handling**: Error handling could be improved, especially for network-related issues and reconnection scenarios.

4. **UI Responsiveness**: The UI may become less responsive during high-frequency updates, especially with many concurrent users.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: The application has not been extensively tested across different browsers and devices.

6. **Code Issues**: We encountered and fixed some issues with the code:
   - Fixed issues with accessing aggregate payloads in query handlers by properly unwrapping ResultBox objects
   - Resolved ambiguous reference issues with IHttpMessageHandlerFactory by creating a custom interface

## Application URLs

When running the application using the Aspire host, the following URLs are available:

- **Frontend**: https://localhost:7201
  - Admin page: https://localhost:7201/planning
  - Participant page: https://localhost:7201/questionair

- **API Service**: https://localhost:7202

- **Aspire Dashboard**: https://localhost:17044

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Add authentication for the admin page
2. Improve error handling and reconnection logic
3. Optimize performance for large numbers of responses
4. Add more detailed statistics and visualizations
5. Implement export functionality for survey results

## Blockers

There are currently no blockers for the project.

## Notes

- We will be referencing the MessageEachOther sample extensively for SignalR integration
- The Sekiban.Instructions.md document will be used as a guide for implementing event sourcing
- We will start with in-memory storage for simplicity and consider other options as the project progresses
